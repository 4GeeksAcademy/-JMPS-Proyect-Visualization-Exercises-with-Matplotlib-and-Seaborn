# Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
<!--endhide-->

In this practice, you will learn to solve the proposed exercises by applying basic and fundamental visualization techniques, using `matplotlib` to create more customizable graphs from scratch, and `seaborn` to generate more elegant statistical graphs with less code.
